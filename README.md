This is the code for the ACM MM2024 paper "Information Fusion with Knowledge Distillation for Fine-grained Remote Sensing Object Detection"

Our codes are based on mmrotate. Please follow the installation of mmrotate and make sure you can run it successfully.

Add and Replace the codes Add the configs/. in our codes to the configs/ in mmdetectin's codes. Add the mmdet/models/detectors/. in our codes to the mmdet/models/detectors/.
